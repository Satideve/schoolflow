# backend/app/services/pdf/context_loader.py

"""
Context loader utilities for invoice and receipt PDF rendering.

This module exposes two functions used by the PDF renderer:
- load_receipt_context(receipt_id, db)  -> dict
- load_invoice_context(invoice_id, db)  -> dict

They return a plain dict of template variables expected by the Jinja templates
used for receipts/invoices. The functions are defensive: they only raise a
ValueError when the requested primary entity (receipt or invoice) is missing.
They try to populate common fields that the templates consume so invoice
rendering (which reuses the receipt renderer) does not fail when a given
field is absent.

This file replaces the previous implementation which accidentally raised
`Receipt <id> not found` during invoice rendering. The new implementation
ensures `load_invoice_context` looks up invoices (not receipts) and also
provides any related `payment` objects so invoice templates that expect
a `payment` variable won't error.
